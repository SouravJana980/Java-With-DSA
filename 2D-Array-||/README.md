🌈 Program Breakdown
🔵 1. Left_and_right_diagonal_sum.java

Calculates the primary (left) and secondary (right) diagonal sums of a square matrix.
Useful for understanding matrix diagonals & sum logic.

🟣 2. Print_boundary_of_matrix.java

Prints the outer boundary (border) of a matrix in order.
Great for improving loop control & edge handling.

🟡 3. Print_each_colunm_sum.java

Loops through each column and prints the column-wise sum.
Enhances the understanding of column traversal.

🔴 4. Search_number_using_staircase.java

Implements the famous Staircase Search
🔍 Time Complexity: O(n + m)
Perfect for sorted 2D arrays.

🟢 5. Spiral_matrix.java

Prints the matrix in beautiful spiral order.
A classic & frequently asked DSA pattern problem.

🟠 6. Swaping_row_and_colunm.java

Swap any two rows or two columns of a matrix.
Important for matrix manipulation basics.
