🌈 File Index and Descriptions: By Category 🎨📊

The files are categorized below for easier learning, using distinct and varied emoji colors for each group!

Category 1: Creation & I/O (The Bright Basics)

File Name

Description

Key Concept Demonstrated

🆕 Create_array.java

The necessary starting point! Demonstrates the fundamental syntax for declaring and initializing a basic array.

🔴 New Array (Declaration & Init)

📥 Array_input_and_output_simple_way.java

Shows basic array input (hardcoded or simple assignments) and outputting elements.

🟠 I/O (Simple Assignments)

🔄 Array_inpuyt_and_output_using_loop.java

Uses loops (for loop, Scanner) to efficiently read data into an array and print its contents.

🟡 Traversal (Looping)

🧩 Array_as_function_arguments.java

Illustrates how to pass an array to a method (function) in Java and modify its contents.

🟤 Function Arguments (Reference)

Category 2: Length & Properties (The Cool Hues)

File Name

Description

Key Concept Demonstrated

🔑 Find_length_of_array_suing_keyword.java

Uses the built-in .length property (the easy way) to determine the size of an array.

🟦 Length Property (.length)

📏 Find_length_of_array_manually.java

A conceptual exercise to understand iteration by calculating array length manually (e.g., using a counter).

💎 Manual Length (Conceptual)

Category 3: Searching & Sorting Algorithms (The Vibrant Greens)

File Name

Description

Key Concept Demonstrated
