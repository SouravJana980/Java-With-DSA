## 🎯 **Concepts Explained**

### 1️⃣ **Abstraction**

* Allows hiding implementation details and showing only essential features.
* Abstract classes and methods enforce a contract for subclasses.

### 2️⃣ **Inheritance**

* Mechanism to create a new class from an existing class.
* Types covered:

  * Single-level: Child inherits from parent
  * Multi-level: Chain of inheritance
  * Hierarchical: Multiple children inherit from one parent
  * Hybrid: Combination of multiple types

### 3️⃣ **Polymorphism**

* Ability of an object to take many forms.
* Method Overloading: Same method name, different parameters (compile-time)
* Method Overriding: Subclass provides its own implementation (runtime)

### 4️⃣ **Encapsulation**

* Wrapping data (variables) and methods into a single unit (class).
* Use of private variables with getters and setters.

### 5️⃣ **Key OOP Benefits**

* Code reusability
* Scalability and maintainability
* Improved readability and structure
* Strong foundation for real-world applications
