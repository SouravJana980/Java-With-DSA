🌈✨ Sorting Algorithms in Java — Complete Collection

Welcome to this repository!
This project contains clean, beginner-friendly, and interview-focused implementations of essential Sorting Algorithms in Java — both manual and inbuilt.

Each file represents a separate algorithm with simple logic, optimized structure, and efficient code design.

🎯 Project Overview

This repository covers:

🔵 Bubble Sort

🟢 Selection Sort

🟣 Insertion Sort

🟠 Counting Sort

🟡 Inbuilt Sorting (Ascending / Descending)

🔴 Inbuilt Sorting Using Index

All code is written in Java, tested, and formatted for easy understanding.
Perfect for beginners, students, and coding interview practice.
